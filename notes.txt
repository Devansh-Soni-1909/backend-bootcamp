Nodemon is a tool that helps with auto-reloading your Node.js application whenever you make changes to the code
mostly for middlewares we use app.use()

Middleware helps you handle common tasks during a request-response lifecycle without repeating code.

🚗 Real-World Analogy: A Toll Booth Highway
🛣 Scenario:
Imagine you're driving your car on a highway that leads to a destination (just like a client sending a request to a server).

Before you reach your destination (i.e., get the final response), you must pass through several checkpoints (middlewares) on the road:

💡 Real-World Checkpoints ≈ Middleware
Checkpoint on the Road	Equivalent Express Middleware	Purpose
🚧 Toll Booth	express.json()	Checks if your vehicle (request body) is valid
👮 Security Check	Authentication Middleware	Checks if you're authorized to enter
🎫 Ticket Validation	Authorization Middleware	Checks if you're allowed to go to a VIP area
🧾 Receipt Printing	Logger Middleware	Logs details about the journey
🧰 Road Repair Detour	Error Handling Middleware	Redirects or shows an error if road is broken
🏁 Destination	Final Route Handler	Sends the final response


HTTP response status codes
HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five classes:

Informational responses (100 – 199)
Successful responses (200 – 299)
Redirection messages (300 – 399)
Client error responses (400 – 499)
Server error responses (500 – 599)
